# Designia Backend API Docs

These notes summarise REST endpoints exposed by the Django backend. Each mini app has its own sheet:

- [Activity](activity/endpoints.md)
- [Authentication](authentication/endpoints.md)
- [Chat](chat/endpoints.md)
- [Marketplace](marketplace/endpoints.md)
- [Payment System](payment_system/endpoints.md)

All routes are served under the `/api/` prefix (see `designiaBackend/urls.py`). Use the per-app pages for request and response details.
